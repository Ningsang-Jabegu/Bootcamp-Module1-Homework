# Bootcamp-Module1-Homework

This project is a part of the Front End Web Development Bootcamp from Westcliff University. It focuses on building static web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing various functionalities such as a digital clock, random code generation, and dynamically added content.

_First updated: July 1, 2021_

## Project Structure

- **HTML Files:**
  - `index.html`: The homepage introducing California's greatest cliffs.
  - `cliff.html`: A detailed page about the four unique cliffs.
  - `activities.html`: A table showcasing planned activities at each cliff.
  - `contact.html`: A contact form page with email, phone, and a random code verification system.

- **JavaScript Files:**
  - `digiclock.js`: Displays the current time, formatted in AM/PM with time zones.
  - `randomcodes.js`: Generates a random 8-character code for verification in the contact form and enables/disables the submit button based on code input.
  - `site_script.js`: Dynamically generates and displays a list of partner images from JavaScript.

- **CSS Files:**
  - `style.css`: Styles the entire website, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.

## Key Features

### 1. Digital Clock (`digiclock.js`)
This script displays the current local time on the homepage. The time is updated every second and is shown in 12-hour format with an appropriate time zone (PT, MT, CT, ET).

### 2. Random Code Generator (`randomcodes.js`)
- Generates a random code from a set of alphanumeric characters, including special symbols.
- This code is displayed in the contact form.
- The user must enter the correct code to enable the "Inquire" button.

### 3. Dynamic Partner List (`site_script.js`)
- Dynamically creates a list of partner images from JavaScript and adds them to the HTML `ul` element.
- The list of partners is displayed on the homepage under the "Our Partners" section.

### 4. Responsive Design
- The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and flexible layouts.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ningsang-Jabegu/Bootcamp-Module1-Homework.git

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
- The homepage introduces California's greatest cliffs and displays a live digital clock.
- Navigate to the other sections (Cliffs, Activities, Contact) using the navigation bar.

3. **Interactive Features:**
- Check out the dynamic partner list on the homepage, generated by JavaScript.
- Visit the contact page and try entering the random code in the contact form to unlock the submission button.
